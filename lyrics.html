    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <pre>
            I don't want a friend (just me)
            I want my life in two (my life in two)
            Just one more night
            Waiting to get there
            Waiting for you (all night)
            I'm done fighting all night (waiting for you)

            When I'm around slow dancing in the dark
            Don't follow me, you'll end up in my arms
            You have made up your mind
            I don't need no more signs
            Can you?
            Can you?

            Give me reasons we should be complete
            You should be with him, I can't compete
            You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
            Can't you see? (Can't you see?)
            I don't wanna slow dance (I don't want to slow dance)
            In the dark
            Dark

            When you gotta run
            Just hear my voice in you (my voice in you)
            Shutting me out of you (shutting me out of you)
            Doing so great (so great, so great)
            You

            Used to be the one (used to be the one)
            To hold you when you fall
            Yeah, yeah, yeah (when you fall, when you fall)
            I don't fuck with your tone (I don't fuck with your tone)
            I don't wanna go home (I don't wanna go home)
            Can it be one night?
            Can you?
            Can you?

            Give me reasons we should be complete
            You should be with him, I can't compete
            You looked at me like I was someone else, oh well
            Can't you see?
            I don't wanna slow dance (I don't want to slow dance)
            In the dark
            Dark
            In the dark
            Dark
